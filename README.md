# React Project README

## Description

Our project includes an Authentication Mechanism for secure access. The Resource List Page offers a structured overview of resources, while the Resource Detail Page enriches insights for informed decisions. Data Enrichment improves data quality, and Deep Linking enhances navigation within the application.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/preet2301/scriptAssistPractical-.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** :
   cd your-project

3. **Install dependencies**:
   npm install

4. **Start the development server**:
   npm start

5. **To implement authentication, we'll establish a method that validates login requests and transitions between public and private pages to demonstrate authenticated access. Ideally, the authentication state should persist between sessions through client-side storage. Regarding login authorization, we'll statically validate email and password credentials according to predefined criteria.** :
   email:admin@gmail.com
   Password:admin@123

6. **The table has been meticulously crafted to display comprehensive details, while an added functionality facilitates efficient searching by name.**

7. **Upon clicking the name field in the table, all associated details are elegantly presented within a card format.**
